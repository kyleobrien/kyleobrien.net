title: Make Testing More Agile
type: text/x-markdown

+ Scrum Guide says that testing in sprint is a requirement.
    - SG: “Development Teams deliver an Increment of product functionality every Sprint. This Increment is useable, so a Product Owner may choose to immediately release it.”
    - SG: “Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.”
+ How?
    1. Each developer has only one work in progress story.
        + Don't start working on a new item until the one you’re working on is tested and done.
        + If there’s a gap between the time a developer finishes implementation and the tester finishes testing, use it for:
            - Refactoring
            - Documentation
            - Unit Tests
    2. Keep stories as small as possible.
        + Break stories down into chunks that can be tested without the whole finished (tasks).
            - SG: “Work planned for the first days of the Sprint by the Development Team is decomposed by the end of this meeting, often to units of one day or less.
    3. Bug fixes take priority over new work and make it into nightly builds.
    4. Only put stories into a sprint if they are testable or product owner agrees to not test them.
    5. Anything that doesn’t get done by the end of the sprint always get moved to the next.
