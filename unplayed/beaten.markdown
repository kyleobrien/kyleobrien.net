Those that have fallen.

- Old Man's Journey 2017.07.18 ([iOS](http://oldmansjourney.com)) (Visuals an Audio were great. Gameplay was meh. Story was predictable.)
- Lara Croft GO / 2016.10.18, 2017.06.24 ([iOS](http://laracroftgo.com)) (Much more than I expected. Such polish. Music was perfect. The Mirror of Spirits was a worthy addition.)
- Firewatch / 2017.03.17 ([XBone](http://www.firewatchgame.com)) (Lived up to the hype. The more I think about it, the more I like it.)
- Hidden Folks / 2017.03.08 ([iOS](http://hiddenfolks.com)) (It was ok.)
- Super Mario Run / 2017.02.18 ([iOS](https://supermariorun.com/sp/en/index.html)) (100% all coins, except for the black special course. Took some time, but warmed up to it.)
- Goblin Sword / 2016.12.08 ([iOS](http://www.gelatogames.com/p/goblin-sword.html?m=1)) (100%-ed this one. Pretty good, but some of the end game achievements were a slog.)
- RÃ©publique / 2016.10.08 ([iOS](https://camouflaj.com)) (The collectathon and fidgety touch controls detracted from the overall game. Ending was unsatisying.)
- Waking Mars ([iOS](http://www.tigerstylegames.com/wakingmars/)) (Skipped the worse ending, but got the normal and alternate ones. They felt bizarrely abrupt to me.)
- Blackbar / 2016.04.06 ([iOS](http://mrgan.com/blackbar/)) (Reminded me of Desert Golf's purity. Inspiring how much some can can do with so little.)
- Bastion / 2016.04.03 ([iOS](http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242)) (Solid. Stuck around for NG+, but didn't 100% the acheivements with the dreams. Great voice acting and soundtrack.)
- Pink Heaven / 2015.10.21 ([iOS](http://playism-games.com/game/244/pink-heaven)) (Still got it.)
- Kometen / 2015.08.23 ([iOS](http://eriksvedang.com/kometen/)) (Enjoyed leisurely exploring the galaxy for artwork. Would have loved a retina update to this old, underappreciated gem.)
- Monument Valley / 2014.12.12, 2014.04.07 ([iOS](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com)) (Short, but sweet. A touch focused, lite version of Fez. Very charming. Played Forgotten Shores on most recent playthrough.)
- Attack of the Friday Monsters / ??? ([3DS](http://level5ia.com/blackbox/us/friday-monsters/))(Charming. Wished the card battle minigame was engaging.)
- Space Age / 2014.12.10 ([iOS](http://spaceageapp.com))(Let down. Dialog dragged and lacked user control. Controls finicky in places where timing was important. Got all the achievements.)
- Desert Golfing / 2014.11.07 ([iOS](http://desertgolfing.captain-games.com))(Pure game. Stopped at hole 1000.)
- Pink Hour / 2014.08.22 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/pinkhour/))(Extremely short prequel to Kero Blaster. Hard mode was fun.)
- Broken Age: Part 1 / 2014.06.29 ([Mac](http://www.brokenagegame.com))(First adventure game in a while. Gorgeous style, interesting story. Puzzles never felt too obscure. Thinking about that cliffhanger.)
- SteamWorld Dig / 2014.06.22 ([3DS](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/)) (Catchy, finished in just a few days. Enjoyed the mining hook. Combat could have been better. Difficulty ramp faster as well. Got 2 gold star for gold and orbs, silver for deaths, bronze for time.)
- Kero Blaster / 2014.06.13 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/keroblaster/)) (Best platforming iOS so far. Great, quirky NPC interactions. Played through once, with new game plus and boss rush mode. Only got 1 of 4 upgrades to secret Kuro Blaster.)
- Shuten / 2014.03.26  ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/6/shuten)) (Finally beat the last boss. Fist shmup I've played to completion. Thoroughly enjoyed.)
- Tappingo / 2014.03.25 ([3DS](http://www.goodbyegalaxygames.com/tappingo/)) (First half was promising, but difficulty never increased. Puzzles got larger, making tap targets smaller, upping frustration.)
- Mega Man / 2014.03.09 ([NES](http://megaman.capcom.com)) (Whoa unbalanced. A few parts required random luck, rather than skill.)
- Home / 2014.02.11 ([iPad](http://homehorror.com)) (Didn't get the appeal. Story felt too direct, repetitive. iPad controls at the edges of the screen were wonky.)
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds ([3DS](http://zelda.com/link-between-worlds/)) (100% item completion, but I died once. Will go for perfect on a Hero mode replay. Minor flaws aside, this game was delightful. A fitting sequel.)
- Longest Night: NITW Supplement 1 / 2013.12.22 ([Mac](http://www.nightinthewoods.com)) (Matching stars based on sound to form a constellation was an idea I had a while ago. Nice to see it in action.)
- Year Walk / 2013.10.20 ([iOS](http://simogo.com/games/yearwalk/)) (Wow.)
- Wub Wub Wescue / 2013.09.23 ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/4/beat-drop)) (Probably my least favorite of the crunch so far, but still fun platforming.)
- Walking Dead: The Game / 2013.08.27 ([iOS](http://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead)) (Enjoyed the story, despite jerky performance on older iPad. Annoyed by instances where multiple choices didn't properly convey tone, ended up making unintended decisions.)
- Gunman Clive ([3DS](http://www.gunmanclive.com)) (Solid, but shallow side-scroller. Visuals were charming in a hand-drawn sort of way. Beat on normal and hard difficulties.)
- GAIAttack ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/2/gaiattack)) (Standard, 2D beat'em up. Fun. Had the top score and time for a while, but someone beat my time. Too busy to try and top it.)
- End of Line ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1/end-of-line)) (Pretty solid. Played it a second time for the 'good' ending.)
- Angle Isle ([iOS](http://rustymoyher.com/ludumdare/angleisle/)) (Super fun platformer. Short, but I had a blast speedrunning. Currently on top for all difficulty levels as of this writing.)
- Millinaut ([Mac](http://www.shauninman.com/ludumdare/millinaut/)) (Some challenging platforming. Didn't know I could swap the boulder and rocket until the last level, so that made the game harder than it should have been.)
- Kentucky Route Zero: Act 1 ([Mac](http://kentuckyroutezero.com)) (Really enjoying the feel of this thing. Can't wait for the rest of it.)
- Super Mario Advance 4 ([GBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3)) (Not as good as I remember, but still solid. Levels felt too short.)
- Super Clew Land ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com)) (Great platform work. Some really nice challenges as well. Played through 2x.)
- Midas ([Mac](http://wanderlands.org/main/midas)) (Simple, but nicely executed puzzle platformer. Liked the thin narrative that went with it.)
- Beatdown! ([iOS](http://www.ravenousgames.com/games)) (Unremarkable, no weapon differentiation. One play through was enough.)
