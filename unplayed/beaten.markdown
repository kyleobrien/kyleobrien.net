Those that have fallen.

- Castlevania: Circle of the Moon / 2025.02.13 ([NSW](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Castlevania:_Circle_of_the_Moon)) (First Castlevania game I've ever beaten. 94% map completion. Made it just shy of halfway through the battle arena.)
- Portal 2 / 2024.12.27 ([NSW](https://www.thinkwithportals.com)) (Fonder memories of the first game. Didn't enjoy the more open, mid-game puzzles compared to the focused test chambers.)
- The Legend of Zelda: Echos of Wisdom / 2024.12.01 ([NSW](https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-switch/)) (On the easy side. Still ejoyed it, but I hope they do Zelda better next time.)
- What Remains of Edith Finch / 2024.09.20 ([NSW](https://www.annapurna.com/interactive/what-remains-of-edith-finch)) (Note sure what to make of this. Did not enjoy the walking around part. Interesting-ness of individual family members' stories varied dramatically.)
- Fez / 2024.09.01 ([NSW](http://www.fezgame.com)) (All cubes, anti-cubes, and artifacts. One heart piece. Didn't do the riddle or the black monolith. After more than 10 years, I finally finished it.)
- Super Mario Bros. Wonder / 2024.06.09 ([NSW](https://supermariobroswonder.nintendo.com)) (Solid, but not as memorable as other Mario games. Everything but the Final-Final Test Badge Marathon, cause I couldn't make the last, invisible jump.)
- Princess Peach: Showtime! / 2024.05.12 ([NSW](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Princess-Peach-Showtime--2444445.html)) (100%. Style and presentation were great, gameplay was meh.)
- Ratcheteer / 2023.08.14 ([PDU](https://play.date/games/ratcheteer/)) (I like Shaun's work. I'm using this little web app, after all. 100%, except for runes G and P.)
- Omaze / 2023.07.15 ([PDU](https://play.date/games/omaze/)) (Nicely crafted puzzler for the device. Every puzzle was just the right amount of different enough from the last.)
- Pick Pack Pup / 2023.06.29 ([PDU](http://pickpackpup.com)) (Solid match 3. Story mode was varied enough to keep me interested, and the narrative wasnt't bad. Other modes didn't feel compelling.)
- Tunic / 2023.05.14 ([NSW](https://tunicgame.com)) (One of my favorites of all time. Translated the language and almost 100%. Couldn't solve the beach poem riddle and didn't do the trophy room puzzle.)
- Casual Birder / 2023.05.05 ([PDU](https://radstronomical.com/Casual-Birder)) (Photographed 26/27 birbs! Who's the casual now?)
- Unpacking / 2023.02.27 ([NSW](http://www.unpackinggame.com)) (Liked parts of it, but had to slog through to the end. Expected a twist that never came.)
- Quake / 2023.01.01 ([NSW](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/quake-switch/)) (Played on normal difficulty. No saves on original game. Saves on the two expansions because late map platforming is dumb. It was okay?)
- The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening / 2022.09.20 ([NSW](https://www.nintendo.com/store/products/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-switch/)) (If only they would have made the performance just a little better. Otherwise excellent.)
- Super Mario Odyssey / 2022.08.08 ([NSW](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Odyssey)) (All moons and purple coins. Got to 980-ish on my own, guides for the rest.)
- Dragon Quest / 2022.07.16 ([iOS](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Quest)) (Not a lot of depth here. Mostly smashing face and healing.)  
- Mega Man X / 2022.02.20 ([SNES](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_X)) (Started this a while ago, but left it at Sigma. Came back to finish the fight.)
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past / 2022.02.13 ([SNES](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past)) (Can't count the number of times I've played this before, but played through it with Liam at his request.)
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild / 2022.02.05 ([NSW](https://www.zelda.com/breath-of-the-wild/)) (Put in somewhere between 225 and 250 hours. Pretty close to 100% with no guides. Except for Knight's Saddle and a little more than half of the Korok seeds, think I got everything. Not perfect, but it was a worthy break from tradition. Can't wait for the sequel.)
- Super Metroid / 2021.09.11 ([SNES](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Metroid))(Somehow never beat this as a kid. Played through with Liam watching. All main items, 76% completion.)
- Hitman GO / 2021.06.08 ([iOS](https://www.square-enix-montreal.com/hitmango))(Picked this up after dropping it 4.5 years ago. Something clicked the second time around. 3-stared every level. No Lara Croft GO, but serviceable.)
- SteamWorld Quest: Hand of Gilgamech / 2021.04.18 ([iOS](https://imageform.se/game/steamworld-quest/))(Was really high on this at the beginning, but started coming down about 50% through. Bottomed out just before the end. Never felt like I got my party working together. Left the last few levels of the arena, or colosseum, or whatever it's called undone.)
- The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask / 2020.10.26 ([3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Majora's_Mask))(I loved it. A truly amazing achievement.)
- Inmost / 2020.06.13 ([iOS](https://inmostgame.com))(Pixel art was tight, but gameplay was meh. Very buggy. Writing was a bit heavy-handed. Felt repetitive.)
- Assemble with Care / 2020.06.04 ([iOS](https://www.assemblegame.com))(Not much of a game here, but a well-crafted experience. Would love to make something this cared for once in my life.)
- The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time / 2020.05.16 ([3DS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time))(First 3D Zelda. Finally. Dungeons were good, overworld was a little underwhelming. Had to restart 66% of the way through. Didn’t get all the hearts and the golden scale because the fishing game was the worst.)
- Card of Darkness / 2019.11.28 ([iOS](http://cardofdarkness.com))(Not my favorite genre of game, but kept me entertained enough to finish. Got all 50 cards. Times when I was rolling over enemies felt great.)
- Metroid: Return of Samus / 2019.11.23 ([3DS](https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/metroid-samus-returns-3ds/))(Modern affordances of having a map with flagged points of interest and detecting hidden areas were welcome. 92% completion on my own. Had to look up the other 8% which all relies on spider ball jumping which I did not know was a thing.)
- WHAT THE GOLF / 2019.12.13 ([iOS](https://whatthegolf.com))(Almost bailed on this one midway through, but stuck with it. Glad I did, but don’t think I would ever want to replay. 100%.)
- Bleak Sword / 2019.12.28 ([iOS](https://devolverdigital.com/games/bleak-sword/))(Ok, I guess. Not motivated enough to replay at a higher difficulty or complete additional achievements.)
- Minit / 2019.09.14 ([iOS](https://www.devolverdigital.com/games/minit)) (Enjoyed first play through, but interest plummeted on NG+. 83% on my own, guides to get up to 110%.)
- Oddmar / 2019.03.30 ([iOS](http://www.oddmargame.com)) (100% achievements. Short, jumping was floaty, but I still liked it.)
- Super Mario World / 2019.02.10 ([SNES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_World)) (High 80's out of 96 levels. 100% Star Road. Played through with Liam, and it is still a masterpiece.)
- Grimvalor / 2019.01.20 ([iOS](https://direlight.com/grimvalor/)) (Started well, but got repetitive. Grappling orb pizzles were frustrating with touch controls. Would have gotten 100% completion otherwise.)
- Her Story / 2018.12.14 ([iOS](https://www.herstorygame.com)) (Frustrated by the limitations of the terminal interface. Just wanted easier access to the clips I had already uncovered. Strong premise, thought the execution came up a little short.)
- Mega Man 2 / 2018.11.29 ([NES](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_Man_2)) (Still as good as ever. Had to use a single energy tank on Wiley.)
- Donut County / 2018.09.02 ([iOS](http://donutcounty.com)) (Simple, but so well executed. Loved the writing, especially the banter between Mira and BK. The Trashopedia was a great example of the amount of care that went into this thing. Found a couple of the easter eggs that were meant as PS4 trophies...)
- Florence / 2018.08.19 ([iOS](http://florencegame.com)) (A few interesting moments, and the art/music were superb. Female driven narrative was also a welcome change. Simple mechanics were fine, but often felt repetitive.)
- SteamWorld Heist ([iOS](http://imageform.se/game/steamworld-heist/)) (All 123 stars. It was ok, I guess?)
- Device 6 / 2018.03.12 ([iOS](http://simogo.com/games/device6/)) (I love the style of game that Simogo makes. A worthy follow up to Year Walk.)
- Monument Valley 2 / 2018.02.26 ([iOS](https://www.monumentvalleygame.com)) (Seemed a lot shorter than the original and on the easier side, but it was still nice to be back.)
- Gorogoa / 2017.12.21 ([iOS](http://gorogoa.com))(Pretty great. Never got stuck and the exploration felt natural. Beautifully drawn, short and sweet.)
- Limbo / 2017.12.07 ([Mac](http://limbogame.org))(Mostly positive. Industrial levels were way less interesting than the forest in the first half of the game. Like that there was no loading screen and each puzzle flowed directly to the next. Didn't feel strongly about the sudden ending either way.)
- Stranger Things / 2017.11.26 ([iOS](http://bonusxp.com/games/stranger-things-the-game/))(Played for the novelty more than anything. When it wore off, I was close enough to push through to the end. 90% completion on my own, used guides to get the full 100%.)
- Doom / 2017.09.17 ([XBone](http://doom.com/en-us/)) (Beaten on Ultra-Violence. Nailed the classic Doom feel. Story was terrible, as expected. Why does Bethesda make everything so reflective?)
- Framed / 2017.09.15 ([iOS](http://loveshackentertainment.com)) (Enjoyed it, but not enough to play the sequel. Felt like it was too hard to tell which frame the protagonist was moving to, which resulted in a lot of trial and error.)
- Old Man's Journey /  2017.07.18 ([iOS](http://oldmansjourney.com)) (Visuals an Audio were great. Gameplay was meh. Story was predictable.)
- Lara Croft GO / 2016.10.18, 2017.06.24 ([iOS](http://laracroftgo.com)) (Much more than I expected. Such polish. Music was perfect. The Mirror of Spirits was a worthy addition.)
- Firewatch / 2017.03.17 ([XBone](http://www.firewatchgame.com)) (Lived up to the hype. The more I think about it, the more I like it.)
- Hidden Folks / 2017.03.08 ([iOS](http://hiddenfolks.com)) (It was ok.)
- Super Mario Run / 2017.02.18 ([iOS](https://supermariorun.com/sp/en/index.html)) (100% all coins, except for the black special course. Took some time, but warmed up to it.)
- Goblin Sword / 2016.12.08 ([iOS](http://www.gelatogames.com/p/goblin-sword.html?m=1)) (100%-ed this one. Pretty good, but some of the end game achievements were a slog.)
- République / 2016.10.08 ([iOS](https://camouflaj.com)) (The collectathon and fidgety touch controls detracted from the overall game. Ending was unsatisying.)
- Waking Mars ([iOS](http://www.tigerstylegames.com/wakingmars/)) (Skipped the worse ending, but got the normal and alternate ones. They felt bizarrely abrupt to me.)
- Blackbar / 2016.04.06 ([iOS](http://mrgan.com/blackbar/)) (Reminded me of Desert Golf's purity. Inspiring how much some can can do with so little.)
- Bastion / 2016.04.03 ([iOS](http://supergiantgames.com/?page_id=242)) (Solid. Stuck around for NG+, but didn't 100% the acheivements with the dreams. Great voice acting and soundtrack.)
- Pink Heaven / 2015.10.21 ([iOS](http://playism-games.com/game/244/pink-heaven)) (Still got it.)
- Kometen / 2015.08.23 ([iOS](http://eriksvedang.com/kometen/)) (Enjoyed leisurely exploring the galaxy for artwork. Would have loved a retina update to this old, underappreciated gem.)
- Monument Valley / 2014.12.12, 2014.04.07 ([iOS](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com)) (Short, but sweet. A touch focused, lite version of Fez. Very charming. Played Forgotten Shores on most recent playthrough.)
- Attack of the Friday Monsters / ??? ([3DS](http://level5ia.com/blackbox/us/friday-monsters/))(Charming. Wished the card battle minigame was engaging.)
- Space Age / 2014.12.10 ([iOS](http://spaceageapp.com))(Let down. Dialog dragged and lacked user control. Controls finicky in places where timing was important. Got all the achievements.)
- Desert Golfing / 2014.11.07 ([iOS](http://desertgolfing.captain-games.com))(Pure game. Stopped at hole 1000.)
- Pink Hour / 2014.08.22 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/pinkhour/))(Extremely short prequel to Kero Blaster. Hard mode was fun.)
- Broken Age: Part 1 / 2014.06.29 ([Mac](http://www.brokenagegame.com))(First adventure game in a while. Gorgeous style, interesting story. Puzzles never felt too obscure. Thinking about that cliffhanger.)
- SteamWorld Dig / 2014.06.22 ([3DS](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/)) (Catchy, finished in just a few days. Enjoyed the mining hook. Combat could have been better. Difficulty ramp faster as well. Got 2 gold star for gold and orbs, silver for deaths, bronze for time.)
- Kero Blaster / 2014.06.13 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/keroblaster/)) (Best platforming iOS so far. Great, quirky NPC interactions. Played through once, with new game plus and boss rush mode. Only got 1 of 4 upgrades to secret Kuro Blaster.)
- Shuten / 2014.03.26  ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/6/shuten)) (Finally beat the last boss. Fist shmup I've played to completion. Thoroughly enjoyed.)
- Tappingo / 2014.03.25 ([3DS](http://www.goodbyegalaxygames.com/tappingo/)) (First half was promising, but difficulty never increased. Puzzles got larger, making tap targets smaller, upping frustration.)
- Mega Man / 2014.03.09 ([NES](http://megaman.capcom.com)) (Whoa unbalanced. A few parts required random luck, rather than skill.)
- Home / 2014.02.11 ([iPad](http://homehorror.com)) (Didn't get the appeal. Story felt too direct, repetitive. iPad controls at the edges of the screen were wonky.)
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds ([3DS](http://zelda.com/link-between-worlds/)) (100% item completion, but I died once. Will go for perfect on a Hero mode replay. Minor flaws aside, this game was delightful. A fitting sequel.)
- Longest Night: NITW Supplement 1 / 2013.12.22 ([Mac](http://www.nightinthewoods.com)) (Matching stars based on sound to form a constellation was an idea I had a while ago. Nice to see it in action.)
- Year Walk / 2013.10.20 ([iOS](http://simogo.com/games/yearwalk/)) (Wow.)
- Wub Wub Wescue / 2013.09.23 ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/4/beat-drop)) (Probably my least favorite of the crunch so far, but still fun platforming.)
- Walking Dead: The Game / 2013.08.27 ([iOS](http://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead)) (Enjoyed the story, despite jerky performance on older iPad. Annoyed by instances where multiple choices didn't properly convey tone, ended up making unintended decisions.)
- Gunman Clive ([3DS](http://www.gunmanclive.com)) (Solid, but shallow side-scroller. Visuals were charming in a hand-drawn sort of way. Beat on normal and hard difficulties.)
- GAIAttack ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/2/gaiattack)) (Standard, 2D beat'em up. Fun. Had the top score and time for a while, but someone beat my time. Too busy to try and top it.)
- End of Line ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1/end-of-line)) (Pretty solid. Played it a second time for the 'good' ending.)
- Angle Isle ([iOS](http://rustymoyher.com/ludumdare/angleisle/)) (Super fun platformer. Short, but I had a blast speedrunning. Currently on top for all difficulty levels as of this writing.)
- Millinaut ([Mac](http://www.shauninman.com/ludumdare/millinaut/)) (Some challenging platforming. Didn't know I could swap the boulder and rocket until the last level, so that made the game harder than it should have been.)
- Kentucky Route Zero: Act 1 ([Mac](http://kentuckyroutezero.com)) (Really enjoying the feel of this thing. Can't wait for the rest of it.)
- Super Mario Advance 4 ([GBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3)) (Not as good as I remember, but still solid. Levels felt too short.)
- Super Clew Land ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com)) (Great platform work. Some really nice challenges as well. Played through 2x.)
- Midas ([Mac](http://wanderlands.org/main/midas)) (Simple, but nicely executed puzzle platformer. Liked the thin narrative that went with it.)
- Beatdown! ([iOS](http://www.ravenousgames.com/games)) (Unremarkable, no weapon differentiation. One play through was enough.)
