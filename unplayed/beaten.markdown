Those that have fallen.

- Pink Hour / 2014.08.22 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/pinkhour/))(Extremely short prequel to Kero Blaster. Hard mode was fun.)
- Broken Age: Part 1 / 2014.06.29 ([Mac](http://www.brokenagegame.com))(First adventure game in a while. Gorgeous style, interesting story. Puzzles never felt too obscure. Thinking about that cliffhanger.)
- SteamWorld Dig / 2014.06.22 ([3DS](http://steamworldgames.com/dig/)) (Catchy, finished in just a few days. Enjoyed the mining hook. Combat could have been better. Difficulty ramp faster as well. Got 2 gold star for gold and orbs, silver for deaths, bronze for time.)
- Kero Blaster / 2014.06.13 ([iOS](http://www.playism-games.com/games/keroblaster/)) (Best platforming iOS so far. Great, quirky NPC interactions. Played through once, with new game plus and boss rush mode. Only got 1 of 4 upgrades to secret Kuro Blaster.)
- Monument Valley / 2014.04.07 ([iOS](http://www.monumentvalleygame.com)) (Short, but sweet. A touch focused, lite version of Fez. Very charming. Will play through a second time when they release more levels.)
- Shuten / 2014.03.26  ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/6/shuten)) (Finally beat the last boss. Fist shmup I've played to completion. Thoroughly enjoyed.)
- Tappingo / 2014.03.25 ([3DS](http://www.goodbyegalaxygames.com/tappingo/)) (First half was promising, but difficulty never increased. Puzzles got larger, making tap targets smaller, upping frustration.)
- Mega Man / 2014.03.09 ([NES](http://megaman.capcom.com)) (Whoa unbalanced. A few parts required random luck, rather than skill.)
- Home / 2014.02.11 ([iPad](http://homehorror.com)) (Didn't get the appeal. Story felt too direct, repetitive. iPad controls at the edges of the screen were wonky.)
- The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds ([3DS](http://zelda.com/link-between-worlds/)) (100% item completion, but I died once. Will go for perfect on a Hero mode replay. Minor flaws aside, this game was delightful. A fitting sequel.)
- Longest Night: NITW Supplement 1 / 2013.12.22 ([Mac](http://www.nightinthewoods.com)) (Matching stars based on sound to form a constellation was an idea I had a while ago. Nice to see it in action.)
- Year Walk / 2013.10.20 ([iOS](http://simogo.com/games/yearwalk/)) (Wow.)
- Wub Wub Wescue / 2013.09.23 ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/4/beat-drop)) (Probably my least favorite of the crunch so far, but still fun platforming.)
- Walking Dead: The Game / 2013.08.27 ([iOS](http://www.telltalegames.com/walkingdead)) (Enjoyed the story, despite jerky performance on older iPad. Annoyed by instances where multiple choices didn't properly convey tone, ended up making unintended decisions.)
- Gunman Clive ([3DS](http://www.gunmanclive.com)) (Solid, but shallow side-scroller. Visuals were charming in a hand-drawn sort of way. Beat on normal and hard difficulties.)
- GAIAttack ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/2/gaiattack)) (Standard, 2D beat'em up. Fun. Had the top score and time for a while, but someone beat my time. Too busy to try and top it.)
- End of Line ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com/games/1/end-of-line)) (Pretty solid. Played it a second time for the 'good' ending.)
- Angle Isle ([iOS](http://rustymoyher.com/ludumdare/angleisle/)) (Super fun platformer. Short, but I had a blast speedrunning. Currently on top for all difficulty levels as of this writing.)
- Millinaut ([Mac](http://www.shauninman.com/ludumdare/millinaut/)) (Some challenging platforming. Didn't know I could swap the boulder and rocket until the last level, so that made the game harder than it should have been.)
- Kentucky Route Zero: Act 1 ([Mac](http://kentuckyroutezero.com)) (Really enjoying the feel of this thing. Can't wait for the rest of it.)
- Super Mario Advance 4 ([GBA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Mario_Advance_4:_Super_Mario_Bros._3)) (Not as good as I remember, but still solid. Levels felt too short.)
- Super Clew Land ([Mac](http://retrogamecrunch.com)) (Great platform work. Some really nice challenges as well. Played through 2x.)
- Midas ([Mac](http://wanderlands.org/main/midas)) (Simple, but nicely executed puzzle platformer. Liked the thin narrative that went with it.)
- Beatdown! ([iOS](http://www.ravenousgames.com/games)) (Unremarkable, no weapon differentiation. One play through was enough.)
