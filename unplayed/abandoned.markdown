Abandon ship.

- Crankin's Time Travel Adventure / 2023.06.02 ([PDU](https://uvula.jp/crankin)) (Got to level 43 out of 50, I think. Can't use the crank with enough precision to get through it.)
- A Monster's Expedition ([iOS](https://www.monsterexpedition.com)) (Repetitive puzzles. Didn't hold my interest.)
- Little Orpheus / 2020.06.27 ([iOS](https://www.littleorpheus.com))(Boring. Protagonist is an unlikeable doofus.)
- Dragalia Lost ([iOS](https://dragalialost.com/sp/en/))(Was going to stick with this for a few weeks, just to get some more exposure to gotcha games. Can't do it. There is no game here. Never again.)
- Oceanhorn ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/oceanhorn/id708196645?mt=8))(At the final boss and 71% completion, but I'm bailing. This game feels like a hollow shell of something good in this genre. Just bland overall.)
- Xenowork / 2017.11.26 ([iOS](http://www.pixelbite.se/more-games/xenowerk/))(So repetitive. Couldn't take it anymore. Enemy variety is weak and the weapon/difficulty treadmill is too obvious.)
- Hearthstone / 2017.08.23 ([iOS](https://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/))(Mostly enjoyed this, but \(a\) I don't have the money to invest in buying packs and \(b\) I don't have the time to play this and something else. Tried for 3 weeks and this was pretty much all I did.)
- Fire Emblem Heroes / 2017.05.15 ([iOS](https://fire-emblem-heroes.com/en/sp/))(My first foray into gotchapon. Did not like.)
- Disney Crossy Road / 2016.04.30 ([iOS](http://games.disney.com/disney-crossy-road))(Endless runners and high score games still don't do it for me.)
- Diablo 3 / 2014.12.30 ([Mac](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/))(Started playing again after recent conversations with Brian and Lynn. I just can't unsee the treadmill.)
- Halo 4 ([Xbox 360](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo4))(Giving up in the middle of a legendary run. Not enough time to keep my skills up when I have so many other games left unplayed. Can't justify cost of Live Gold for multiplayer. Bullet sponge Prometheans aren't fun.) 
- Ridiculous Fishing ([iOS](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com))(Amusing, but not a huge fan of these style of tilt games. Finished the game, aka found the guy's Dad, but only have 61/66 fish collected.)
