Abandon ship.

- Hitman GO / 2016.12.18 ([iOS](https://www.square-enix-montreal.com/hitmango))(Not sure why I didn't find this compelling when I loved Lara Croft GO. Maybe the aesthetics? Felt like i had to do a lot more "rocking" of the character to make a move at the right time.)
- Disney Crossy Road / 2016.04.30 ([iOS](http://games.disney.com/disney-crossy-road))(Endless runners and high score games still don't do it for me.)
- Diablo 3 / 2014.12.30 ([Mac](http://us.battle.net/d3/en/))(Started playing again after recent conversations with Brian and Lynn. I just can't unsee the treadmill.)
- Halo 4 ([Xbox 360](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo4))(Giving up in the middle of a legendary run. Not enough time to keep my skills up when I have so many other games left unplayed. Can't justify cost of Live Gold for multiplayer. Bullet sponge Prometheans aren't fun.) 
- Ridiculous Fishing ([iOS](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com))(Amusing, but not a huge fan of these style of tilt games. Finished the game, aka found the guy's Dad, but only have 61/66 fish collected.)
