Abandon ship.

- Halo 4 ([Xbox 360](https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/games/halo4))(Giving up in the middle of a legendary run. Not enough time to keep my skills up when I have so many other games left unplayed. Can't justify cost of Live Gold for multiplayer. Bullet sponge Prometheans aren't fun.) 
- Ridiculous Fishing ([iOS](http://www.ridiculousfishing.com))(Amusing, but not a huge fan of these style of tilt games. Finished the game, aka found the guy's Dad, but only have 61/66 fish collected.)
