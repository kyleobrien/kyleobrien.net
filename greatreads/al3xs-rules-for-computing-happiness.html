<h1>al3x&#8217;s Rules for Computing Happiness</h1>
<p>A list.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Use as little software as possible.</li>
	<li>Use software that does one thing well.</li>
	<li>Do not use software that does many things poorly.</li>
	<li>Do not use software that must sync over the internet to function.</li>
	<li>Do not use web applications that should be desktop applications.</li>
	<li>Do not use desktop applications that should be web applications.</li>
	<li>Do not use software that isn&#8217;t made specifically for your operating system. (You&#8217;ll know it when you see it because it won&#8217;t look right or work correctly.)</li>
	<li>Do not run beta software unless you <a href="http://stevenf.com/archive/reporting-bugs-in-mac-os-x-apps.php">know how to submit a bug report</a> and are eager to do so.</li>
	<li>Use a plain text editor that you know well. &nbsp;Not a word processor, a plain text editor.</li>
	<li>Do not use your text editor for tasks other than editing text.</li>
	<li>Use a <a href="http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password">password manager</a>. You shouldn&#8217;t know any of your passwords save the one to your primary email account and the one to your password manager.</li>
	<li>Do not use software that&#8217;s unmaintained.</li>
	<li>Pay for software that&#8217;s worth paying for, but only after evaluating it for no less than two weeks.</li>
	<li>Thoroughly delete all traces of software that you no longer use.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hardware</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Do not buy a desktop computer unless your daily computing needs include video/audio editing, 3D rendering, or some other hugely processor-intensive computing task. &nbsp;Buy a portable computer instead.</li>
	<li>Do not use your phone/smartphone/<span class="caps">PDA</span>/<span class="caps">UMPC</span> for tasks that would be more comfortably and effectively accomplished on a full-fledged computer.</li>
	<li>Use a Mac for personal computing.</li>
	<li>Use Linux or <span class="caps">BSD</span> on commodity hardware for server computing.</li>
	<li>Do not use anything other than a Mac at home and Linux/<span class="caps">BSD</span> on the server.</li>
	<li>The only peripheral you absolutely need is a hard disk or network drive to put backups on.</li>
	<li>Buy as large an external display as you can afford if you&#8217;ll be working on the computer for more than three hours at a time.</li>
	<li>Use hosted services in lieu of hosting on your own hardware (or virtual hardware) for all but the most custom applications.</li>
</ul>
<h2>File Formats</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Keep as much as possible in plain text. Not Word or Pages documents, plain text.</li>
	<li>For tasks that plain text doesn&#8217;t fit, store documents in an open standard file format if possible.</li>
	<li>Do not buy digital media crippled by rights restriction technologies unless your intention is to rent the content for a limited period of time.</li>
</ul>
<p>These are my rules and they make me happy. I hope they make you happy too. If you have computing rules of your own that make you happy, I encourage you to publish them.</p>
