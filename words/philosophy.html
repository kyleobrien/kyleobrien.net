<h1 id="aphilosophyofsoftwaredesign">A Philosophy of Software Design</h1>

<h2 id="publishedontuesdaynovember262013">Published on Tuesday, November 26, 2013</h2>

<p>I&#8217;d like to describe a philosophy of software design that will ground my work. It will act as a simple guideline that I can follow when evaluating past, current and future software projects. Rather than an original effort, it&#8217;s a hybrid of two existing philosophies.</p>

<p>First, <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com">Paul Graham</a> says in <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/newthings.html">Six Principles for Making New Things</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here it is: I like to find</p>

<ol>
<li>simple solutions</li>
<li>to overlooked problems</li>
<li>that actually need to be solved, and</li>
<li>deliver them as informally as possible,</li>
<li>starting with a very crude version 1, then</li>
<li>iterating rapidly.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Principles one through three are spot on. I would, however, make a change to the second point. These must be overlooked problems that are meaningful to me. Create things you care about, first and foremost.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2008/11/iphone_likeness">iPhone-Likeness</a>, John Gruber of <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a> writes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Iâ€™ll put forth one central, overriding guideline for iPhone UI design:</p>

<p>Figure out the absolute least you need to do to implement the
idea, do just that, and then polish the hell out of the experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#8217;s difficult to argue with any of this advice. The separation between design and implementation (first the figuring out, then the doing), is especially insightful, if only because it is so often overlooked. The only quibble I have with John&#8217;s philosophy is that it should apply to the design of the entire application, not just the user interface. </p>

<p>And so we get to my own philosophy of software design:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find a simple solution</li>
<li>to one of my overlooked problems</li>
<li>that actually needs to be solved.</li>
<li>Figure out the absolute least I need to do to implement the solution,</li>
<li>do it, then</li>
<li>polish the heck out of the experience.</li>
</ol>

<p>I can&#8217;t claim that this philosophy will result in a commercially viable product. But I do believe it will help me create something that I can care about. And that is what matters.</p>
