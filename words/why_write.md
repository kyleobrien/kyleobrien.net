I should have started writing publicly years ago, but I was afraid that I wouldn't have anything meaningful to say. I also assumed my future self would be successful and the writing would follow naturally as a result. Well, I'm not and it hasn't.

People in the Mac and iOS development communities who I admire greatly, people like [Brent](http://inessential.com), [Daniel](http://bitsplitting.org) and [Manton](http://www.manton.org), have repeatedly emphasized the importance of maintaining a public blog. Well, I’m finally ready to stop procrastinating and take their advice. I know I will struggle and most of what ends up here will be garbage. So it goes.

I'm not sure what direction this site will go, but I know I have to get going before I can find that out. There are at least three specific reasons I want to do this:

1. To clarify my own thoughts and feelings. I generally don't need to convince others of my ideas and instinct tells me that my justifications wouldn’t hold up under scrutiny.
2. To join a community of my peers. I live near Buffalo, NY and there are no strong developer or tester communities in the area. Online is what I’ve got.
3. Maybe get some attention. I'm a nobody.
